<h2>Curated Goods Web site</h2>
<p>Scouring the world, Curated Goods creates a short-listed experienceof stylish goods, up and coming designers, and the latest on food, travel and art. A sampling of our latest curated experiences have included locavore textiles and pottery, the perfect Red Wine-Braised Short Ribs, Post-punk design exhibit at the MOMA, Designer collaborations and a tour of the Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort. Below are three responsive wireframes that translates the landing page for desktop, tablet and mobile devices.</p>

		<h3>DESKTOP</h3>
		<center><img src="images/macwireframe.jpg" width="200px"></center>

	<p>Creating a design that is responsive on multiple platforms had me rethink my original wireframe to a design that was more versatile. I decided to make the hero image into a larger "cover" image with no repeat, which would lend itself to a stronger more graphic look especially when reduced to the smaller mobile screen.</p>

<div id="tablet">
<h3>TABLET</h3>
<center><img src="images/tabletwireframe.jpg" width="600px"></center>	
<p>For the tablet edition, I wanted to contain as much as the information on the landing page so that viewers didn't have to scroll as much to navigate to the grid of stories. In this incarnation, the nav bar is hidden under the hamburger menu. There, viewers can access the "about," "blog" and "shop" pages easily.</p></div>

<div id="mobile">
<h3>MOBILE</h3>
<center><img src="images/mobilewireframe.jpg" width="600px"></center>
<p>Keeping things as simple as possible, the landing page for the mobile device shows a more cropped in main image, and the header rebroken to two lines for a better fit. The grid of diamonds, allowing reader access to the categories, are repositioned, so that the icons can be larger when they are stacked with fewer icons per row in the grid. Viewers will have the scroll down to view all icons, but that's a natural incarnation with all mobile devices, especially when there is enough information above the fold to indicate there is more content below. Again, like the tablet edition, the nav bar is easily accessible via the hamburger menu and always present no matter whate page you are on.</p></div>

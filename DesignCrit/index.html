<p>Since begining the course, I've begun to really gain a better grasp of controlling the styles of a web site with the help of CSS. <bold>I have also begun to understand the versatility of web design</bold> and how items on a site can be laid out with the assistance of div tags and manipulation of margins and padding to create better visual spacing and alignment. </p>
<p>In creating the wireframes of my website, I was greatly inspired by the <a href="http://www.apidura.com"> Apidura</a> web site, an adventure bicycling e-commerce/blog site. They have an excellent use of a rotating hero image which makes the viewer feel like they are on the road, in different environments on their bike. It makes you want to buy their gear. I also loved their non traditional hexagonal grid, each with a visual representing its page's store, which is a nice entry point into the content.</p>

<p>
Working to have a better sense of creating perfect alignment of all my objects on page and mastering the art of margins and paddings to get things to sit exactly where I want. I also would like to do more mastering responsive design, so that my end product will look great on a wide variety of different screens and platforms. I would also like to experiment with more fixed elements and try out ghosted rollovers over images. I'm interested in trying the trick with creating a ghosted roll-over effect over a hexagonal grid systems. </p><p>Finally my other main challeange is patience and being organzied!:) Yet each week as I learn more and more how the coding works, I'm also developing a more zen like approach to debunking codes and finally having items sit where I would like them to be. So in a sense, this challenge and my path towards conquering it, is making me feel proud! Any little bit I'm getting a hang of, is certainly a step in the right direction.</div></p>

<a href="http://www.apidura.com"><b>Apidura</b></a>is actually a wonderfully sweet little site that totally brought me back to when I bicycled across Beijing. In creating the wireframes of my final website project, I was greatly inspired by the <a href="http://www.apidura.com"> Apidura</a> web site, an adventure bicycling e-commerce/blog site. They have an excellent use of a rotating hero image which makes the viewer feel like they are on the road, in different environments on their bike. It makes you want to buy their gear. I also loved their non traditional hexagonal grid, each with a visual representing its page's store, which is a nice entry point into the content.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.squarespace.com"><b>Square Space</b></a> is a beautifully sublime and clean web site, where the large headline and hero image easily tells the reader what they will be getting with this site. In fact, they use the visuals on each page so effectively that you almost don't have to read the content to understand what the business is about and the products you offer. The grid of products allows the reader to easily navigate through each template and allow them to imagine what their site could look with the power of square space. Personally, I am a big fan of clean minimal san serif fonts, such as the one used throught out the site. And the hierarchy is set perfectly and the nav bar is present on each page so the reader easily can visit from page to page.</p></div>

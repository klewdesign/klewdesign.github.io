<h2 id="ultra">PROGRESS</h2>   
<p>Since begining the course, I've begun to really gain a better grasp of controlling the styles of a web site with the help of CSS. <bold>I have also begun to understand the versatility of web design</bold> and how items on a site can be laid out with the assistance of div tags and manipulation of margins and padding to create better visual spacing and alignment.</p>
</div>
<div id="challenges"><h2 id="ultra">CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>
Working to have a better sense of creating perfect alignment of all my objects on page and mastering the art of margins and paddings to get things to sit exactly where I want. <bold>I also would like to do more responsive design</bold>, so that my end product will look great on a wide variety of different screens and platforms. Finally, I would like to eventually code in my sleep and work comfortably with these "invisible containers."</div></p>

<a href="http://www.apidura.com"><b>APIDURA</b></a> is a outdoors web site geared for experienced adventurous cyclist, sets the tone immediately with its hero cover image which rotates from one stunning vista to another. Essentially it's saying "look at all the beautiful and awesome places you can go...with our bikesâ€”roads yet to be discovered." What I love about this, is that the site purposely creates this experience for you even from the comfort of your laptop, you get the feeling of being out there on your bike. This site is a perfect hybrid of blog and e-commerce. I really love the way the stories are weaved in with the products, which you can easily access with the inventive use of a clickable grid, all in hexagonal shapes. I am a fan on the non-square.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tinyatlasquarterly.com"><b>TINY ATLAS QUARTERLY</b></a> is a photography site which tells travels stories through beautiful images that incites immense wanderlust. The site achieves this feeling effectively with a grid showcasing the different stories they are telling that month, with wonderful hover states that transition into beautifully hand drawn lettering which tells you the name of the story and location. Clicking onto the story of choice brings you to this amazing hero image. Although I love the visuals and relatively clean design, when visiting other pages, the nav bar on top disappears and you have to scroll to the bottom of the site to click back to the main page. It would be great if every page had the nav bar and there's easier accessibilty into and out of each page.</p></div>
